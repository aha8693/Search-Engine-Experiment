# Search-Engine-Experiment

This is my implementation of hashmap using to different methods of hashing -- open adressing and and chaining -- and profiling with given text files. 

Details: 

• Organize a list of urls from Aa given input (text files) into implemented hashmaps and measure the time and capacity costs for searching the
given list of urls given unique keywords. 

• During the experiment, two different hashmaps are compared with a given, already implemented hashmap -- JdkHashMap -- in terms of their time (ms/op) and 
capacity scores (bytes). The following is the score with JdkHashMap.
